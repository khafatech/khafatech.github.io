- Some cool projects I want to start working on:

    - music visualizer using osc and opengl

    - Interactive image compression and glitching (gif, jpg, webm)
        - gif uses LZW compression 

    - playing with speech synthesis. Can I make animal sounds and weird almost-human noises?

- See `project-ideas.md`
