The concept and practice of simulating things pops up frequently in programming.

Perhaps it's a computer's main function is to simulate something.

What does it mean to simulate?

### What is being simulated?

There are countless examples.

Text editors simulate a typewriter with interactive editing.
A 3d world, a 2d world, a "desktop".

    - copying data from one location to another location
    - comparing two numbers and doing something different based on the result
    - operations on numbers (integers, floating points)
